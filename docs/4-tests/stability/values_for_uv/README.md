# Test measures for UV

We made different measures to see how much energy was received by the captor in the presence of a tank full of water, or with no tank. We obtained those results:

|       |Without tank |With tank + H2O
|-------|-------------|---------------
|Mean   |16255,9      |12492,2
|SD     |18,82        |19,53
