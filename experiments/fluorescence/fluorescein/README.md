# Fluorescein

## Exploratory experiments

The goal is to evaluate the concentration required to have an absorbance of around 0.5

We took 14 mg of fluorescein in 100mL of water

### 14 mg/L

| Color | Absorbance | Emission |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Red   | 0.01       |          |
| Green | 0.43       |          |
| Blue  | 1.79       |          |
| UV    |            | -1358    |

From the previous solution we 0.5mL and bring it to 5mL.

### 1.4 mg/L

| Color | Absorbance | Emission |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Red   | -0.02      |          |
| Green | 0.14       |          |
| Blue  | 0.95       |          |
| UV    |            | -2878    |

### 0.7 mg/L

| Color | Absorbance | Emission |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Red   | 0          |          |
| Green | 0.07       |          |
| Blue  | 0.56       |          |
| UV    |            | 2953     |

### Conclusions

An absorbance in blue of around 0.5 is achieved with a concentration of phenolphathlein of 0.7mg/L.
At this concentration the spectrophotometer has a fluorescence of 2953 internal unit.

369mg of CaCl2.2H2O in 2 + 2 mL (2 experiments) (concentration of 92g/L)

| A   | B   | H2O | R     | G    | B    | UV   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2   | 0   | 2   | -0.00 | 0.09 | 0.52 | 2052 |
| 2   | 0   | 2   | -0.00 | 0.11 | 0.53 | 2088 |

### Conclusion

In presence of CaCl2 at high concentration there is no clear evidence of a fluorescence quenching.

### Conclusions

It seems that we observe a fluorescence quenching but other factors like influence of pH should be checked.
Literature shows that this kind of experiment is done in presence of 0.1M of KOH.
