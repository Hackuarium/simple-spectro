# Goal
This 3D printed part allows the replacement of the four small parts holding the test sample cell while letting light pass through small orifices.

# Advantages of this design
- Fewer parts make the assembly easier.
- The cell is better held, preventing variation in results due to changes in the orientation of the cell.
- A side extension wall prevents the UV LED from directly lighting the sensor.
- A bottom wall prevents light from coming through gaps at the bottom of the cell, ensuring more consistency in test conditions.
