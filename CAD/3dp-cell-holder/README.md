# Goal
This 3D printed part allows to replace the four small parts holding the test sample cell while letting light pass trough small orifices.
# Advangtages of this design
- fewer parts which makes the assembly easier
- the cell is better hold which prevent variation in results due to change in the orientation of the cell
- a side extention wall prevents the UV LED to directly light the sensor
- a bottom wall prevents light from comming from the bottom of the cell trough gaps - more consistency in test conditions
